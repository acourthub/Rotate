# Rotate
This project is the first fully automated system leveraging PumpFun’s new creator fees to fuel perpetual buy pressure. Instead of fees going idle or being siphoned by a team, every creator fee is programmatically routed back into buying the token—creating a self-sustaining flywheel of demand.

Unlike other projects where trust in the dev is required, our system is completely autonomous and immutable. The technology is already live and working—no promises, no roadmaps, no middlemen. Every cycle reinforces the next, compounding momentum with no manual intervention.

In short: fees become fuel, buys never stop, and the flywheel keeps spinning forever.
